There is a folder for each section which contains folders for each question. In these folders, there are the code and explanation / approaches for that particular question.
This is the link to my github repo for the assignment : https://github.com/Adit1230/THP
Feel free to check out my other projects including one to build a basic neural network from scratch without using any AI libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.

I am a fresher who is very enthusiastic about AI and ML and would love to study it further and do research in this field.
However I am just starting to learn about AI and do not have that much knowledge about it currently.
I would love to join the THP team so that I can learn more about AI and its applications and contribute to its research.
