This python program uses cocqui-tts library for converting text to speech.
This library is a newer and more maintained version of mozilla tts.
The program uses tacotron2-DDC model for tts.
A vocoder is used to make the audio feel more real.

When the project updates are written to Project_updates.txt and the program is run, it creates an audio file called audio.wav which has the sudio of the updates being read out.

Requirements:
cocqui-tts library : pip install cocqui-tts
